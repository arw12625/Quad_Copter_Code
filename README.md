Quadcopter code

A small project to build a quadcopter from near-scratch.

The end goal is to have a quadcopter using a 3D printed and aluminum frame, an Arduino Uno for control and a smart phone for vision and communications, and a Pololu MinIMU-9 v3 for inertial data.

Included in the project will be:
CAD/STL files for the quadcopter hardware to be printed
Code to run on the quadcopter Arduino
A GUI to run on a computer/smartphone with wifi for control
